# GoogleColabProjects
This project contains code practice and solutions from a computer vision assignment completed as part of my AI/ML Engineering course. 
Implemented using Google Colab, it includes key techniques such as image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training for visual data analysis.

**#Sample Classification â€“ AI/ML Engineering Assignment**
This project is based on a sample classification task completed during my AI/ML Engineering course. The code was developed in Google Colab using Python, with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and nltk for data processing and model building.
